# js-stackar

**js-stackar** is a fork of [js-aruco2](https://github.com/damianofalcioni/js-aruco2) that supports custom dictionary for square markers. Additionally, this library includes a custom AR marker editor for creating custom AR marker dictionary for various interaction.


## Demos

100% JavaScript (see details bellow):

- [Custom Markers Creator](https://jingruchenmax.github.io/js-stackar/samples/marker-creator/custom-marker-creator.html)

## Markers 

A square grid with an external unused black border. Internal cells contains id information.

## Usage
Create a `Custom.js` file in the `src/dictionaries` folder and paste the code generated by the Custom Marker Creator to use in demos.

```
//example of custom dictionary
AR.DICTIONARIES.MyDictionary = {
  nBits: 25,
  tau: 1,
  codeList: ['0x1084210UL', '0x1084217UL', ...]
};
```
`nBits` must contain the bit dimension of the markers in your dictionary.
`tau` can contain the hamming distance of the codes in your dictionary (optional).
`codeList` must be an array of strings containing the hexadecimal representation of every marker in your dictionary. The order is important because the position in the array represents the marker id.

The defined dictionary is then available to the detector:

```
var detector = new AR.Detector({
  dictionaryName: 'MyDictionary'
});
```
